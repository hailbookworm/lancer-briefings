# Moon Mideel // 1.23.5014u
Newly recruited LANCER pilots **CHOPIN**, **CLEM**, **CROSS** and **SHERIFF** were all assigned to research station Cypress on the moon of Mideel, orbiting a non-habitable planet in the Mako system. Mideel is of particular interest as it once had tectonic activity which suddenly ceased. Despite this, the moon still has a spinning molten core and magnetic field.

Of particular note, the research scientists of the Marin Collective, the research org hired by Serys Co discovered a material dubbed **DEEPGLASS**. **DEEPGLASS** is an incredibly dense and resilient crystalline substance that could have commercial uses ranging from data storage to starship engines.

Research Station Cypress was suddenly attacked from below - an earthquake of extraordinary magnitude caused a chasm to form spanning the length of the station. From beneath, spider like entities, seemingly made of rock and magma skittered up and started ravaging the station, including the scientists.

The squad's commander, **CAPTAIN MARTIN "CRUSHER" LYNGE"** was killed in the initial strike by a boulder flung from a gigantic monstrosity. Showing initiative, Pilot **CROSS** lead the squad in search of a way to reach the mech hanger. Now suited up, the remains of Crusher's Cobalt sheltered scientists while Pilot **SHERIFF** escorted a researcher to obtain a backup of all of the research data etched into a chunk of **DEEPGLASS**. Many of the scientists who survived the initial attack were regrettably killed by friendly fire.

The squad fled into the jungle. At 0744 local time, the squad managed to contact Nest station, the staging and resupply post in geosynhcronous orbit above the nearby planet. They were fed rendezvous coordinates on the other side of the moon and informed that there was hostile mech presence on the moon. Shortly before the rendezvous, the squad engaged and eliminated a small mech strike force registered to pilots from the **MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY**, in employ of one of the Marin Collective's competitors.

Nearly 24 hours after the squad was rescued from the surface of Mideel, they underwent a thorough debrief from **COMMANDER ILYUKHINA PETROVA** regarding the events of the attack on Research Station Cypress. The debrief is more strenuous on some than others.

The four pilots are reorganized into **ANVIL SQUAD**. There is no formal squad leader designation. The Pilots are instructed in no uncertain terms that they are to work together until Internal Affairs deems a reoganization necessary. The squad's license levels are upgraded, and they are dismissed to the hanger of the Euphrates to make any modifications to their mechs. As Lancers working for Internal Affairs, they have mostly free roam of the maintenance hangar, its onboard printers and materials, and the crew decks.

**ANVIL SQUAD** is inturrupted in their shipboard work and assembled for a mission briefing. Things are about to get interesting...
