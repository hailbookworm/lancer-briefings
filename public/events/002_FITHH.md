# UCS Mulberry // 1.28.5014u
**ANVIL SQUAD** successfully landed aboard the stranded Union Civilian Services ship **UCS MULBERRY**, an ore freighter bound for the crown jewel of Union space, **CRADLE**. The **UCS MULBERRY** was infiltrated by a rogue SerisCo NHP, codename **ONYX**.

**ONYX** was a NHP assigned to the SerisCo Weapons Development Program, and carried with it plans for proprietary weapons systems, force deployments and strategic operation locations. Failure to capture and destroy **ONYX** was not an option, as escape would have at minimum brought Union scrutiny upon SerisCo, likely ending in dissolution of the entire corporation.

During its escape from SerisCo facilities, **ONYX** was responsible for the death of almost two hundred research and other base personnel from SerisCo Weapons Development Program facility Thebes.

Onboard the derelict **UCS MULBERRY**, **ANVIL SQUAD** was greeted by total silence. There was no power, no artificial gravity and no life support engaged. 

Making their way through the ship, **ANVIL SQUAD** found signs of incredible violence throughout the corridors and cargo hold. Symbols that had a ritualistic connotation were drawn in blood, presumably that of the crew, in the engine room.

On the bridge of the ship, **ANVIL SQUAD** was confronted by creatures that appeared to be formerly of the **UCS MULBERRY**'s crew, but tortured beyond recognition. These beings did not need to breathe, and thus could survive vacuum. They were stuck through with various lengths of wire and other tubing. As soon as the creatures were disturbed, they jockeyed onto the mechs of **ANVIL SQUAD** with unnatural ferocity, ripping at critical components. The behavior suggests some form of intelligence.

After dispatching the hostiles, **ANVIL SQUAD** learned that an entity designated as **PHOBOS** assisted rogue NHP **ONYX** in boarding and disabling the ship. **PHOBOS** somehow had access to override the automated systems of the **UCS MULBERRY** and left it as a derelict vessel, in addition to creating a carrier wave capable of transmitting the entirety of NHP **ONYX** to the ship's mainframe. On the bridge, **ANVIL SQUAD** was contacted by NHP **ONYX** using the ship's communication systems as a voice. 

In a daring maneuver, Pilots **SHERIFF** and **CLEM** jury rigged the engines of the **UCS MULBERRY** to self destruct. This served the purpose of drawing NHP **ONYX** into a confrontation.

**ONYX** itself had made a body of an amalgamation of corpses of the ship's crew and various other construction materials taken from the ship. Preliminary review by SerisCo research staff indicates that **ONYX** may have used the human corpses as batteries and electrical relays - suggesting that the former crew may not have actually been dead.

After a tense battle involving the nightmare frame and several other hostiles similar to the ones encountered on the bridge, **ANVIL SQUAD** was successful in subduing the body used by NHP **ONYX**. NHP **JASPER** was deployed in a deepglass fragment to absorb and package **ONYX** for deletion and study.
