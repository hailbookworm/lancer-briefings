Formerly a neo-classical celebrity, Simon Pangerstad is well known for both his musical prowess and his short temper. He famously performed entirely solo while on stage. However, after being pressed by his agent, he was due to perform in a symphony for a high-class audience. It famously did not go well after Simon lunged at a member of the orchestra. The leading contributing factor has been cited as his perfectionist personality and sensitivity to anything-but-perfect pitch. Simon voluntarily signed himself for military service long after the incident in an attempt to leave behind his poor public image.
