Marshall Lawrence, heir to an interplanetary shipping company and only child, has traveled the stars far and wide moving cargo, freight, and people to farflung destinations. Easy to spot in his iconic cowboy hat and his six shooter on his hip, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone more well-traveled than him. Marshall puts his faith in his close friends, and this has gotten him hurt a few times before, but that's not about to make him change his ways. If you're looking for a quick shot or a good ally, there's only one person to call.


## Trivia

* Marshall has developed a custom basic Companion NHP that he talks to - maybe a bit too often.
