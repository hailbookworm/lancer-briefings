# Mission // #002
## Fox in the Hen House

SerisCo has been contracted by a small refugee and rebel force on the planet Shamshir. Our client on this one is none other than the last surviving child of a political dissident. The client is currently fleeing across the desert to the city of Vaha, where they have been promised protection by a sympathetic Satrap.

Shamshir is a planet vast with natural resources. It would greatly benefit SerisCo to have a sympathetic ear within the planetary political sphere.

This will be a long term op.

# Goals
- Escort the refugee caravan safely to Vaha
- Protect the client within the city
- If an opportunity comes, install the client as a political power

# Stakes
- If the client dies, not only do we not get paid, but we miss any further opportunity for employment on Shamshir

# Reserves
- Limited supply runs
- Coven squad will be standing by in case a larger force is necessary
